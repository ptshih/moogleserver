== Facebook API Errors
{"error"=>{"type"=>"OAuthException", "message"=>"(#613) Calls to checkin_fql have exceeded the rate of 600 calls per 600 seconds."}}
 - Throttled LOL

{"error_code":1,"error_msg":"An unknown error occurred"}
 - Seems to happen when using multiquery (ids) and there are too many ids

== Moogle TODOs

1. Hook up Yelp cross reference API call and store into Yelp objects - Tom
2. Batch requests to get friends checkins (for each of your friends one at a time) - Peter
   Also we need to store the "last_fetched" timestamp for use in Facebook's since API the next time we hit
3. Serialize more of Facebook places (page) data (serialize_place method in facebook_api.rb) - Tom
4. Create checkin/place APIs in controllers for client to test - Peter

== Low Priority TODOs
1. Add Google Places as a potential API partner
2. Add Foursquare as an API partner
3. Finish up Gowalla API

== Code Snippets

begin
# Your normal code block
rescue SomeException
# ... handling exception
else
# This part only run if the main code did not throw
# an exception.
ensure
# The very last thing to be run before the clause exit.
# Code in the ensure clause will always get execute.
